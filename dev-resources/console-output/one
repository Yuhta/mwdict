[3;1musage[0;0m Sense 2a is usually a sign of a formal style. A formal style excludes the participation of the reader or hearer; thus [3mone[m is used where a less formal style might address the reader directly <for the consequences of such choices, [3mone[m has only oneself to thank â€” Walker Gibson>. This generic [3mone[m has never been common in informal use in either British or American English, and people who start sentences with [3mone[m often shift to another pronoun more natural to casual discourse <when [3mone[m is learning the river, he is not allowed to do or think about anything else â€” Mark Twain>. Use of [3mone[m to replace a first-person pronounâ€”sense 2bâ€”has occasionally been criticized. It is more common in British English than in American <I'm watching this pretty carefully and I hope that the issue will come up in the Lords and [3mone[m may be able to speak about it â€” Donald Coggan>.
